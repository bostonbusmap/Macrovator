# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
        datum: one
        name: "AL one"

# column: value
#
two:
        datum: two
        name: "AL two"

#  column: value
